Repo to automatically sort any folder

# Important note
Currently only Windows is supported due to its weird backslash file system. Unix file systems will be added soon.

# How it works
Once ran, it will automatically move all the files and folders inside the specified root folder into the specific subfolders depending on their extension (if applicable).
Any changes will be printed to the command prompt.

# Setup
1. Navigate to the folder where you want the repo to be (NOT the folder to be sorted): `cd <path>`
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/appuchias/file_sort.git`
3. Navigate into the repo folder: `cd file_sort`
4. Run the file and add the path instead of <path>: `python main.py <path>`
