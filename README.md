# How it works
Once installed, it will automatically move all the files inside the specified folder into the specified subfolders depending on its extension.
Current file extensions include just the ones I could find inside my downloads folder, but more will be aded in the future.

# Setup
1. Navigate to the folder where you want the repo to be (NOT the folder to be sorted): `cd <path>`
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/appuchias/file_sort.git`
3. Navigate into the repo folder: `cd file_sort`
4. Run the file and add the path instead of <path>: `python main.py <path>`
